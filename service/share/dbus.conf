<!-- This configuration file controls the Agama Installer message bus.
     It is based on /usr/share/dbus-1/session.conf but including some changes:
     - Type is set to "org.opensuse.Agama".
     - Removed the policy section for the default context.
     - Added a new policy section for the root user.
     - The local-session.conf file is not read. -->

  a supported credentials-passing mechanism. On those platforms/transports,
  comment out the <auth> element to allow fallback to DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1. -->

  <!-- For the session bus, override the default relatively-low limits 
       with essentially infinite limits, since the bus is just running 
       as the user anyway, using up bus resources is not something we need 
       to worry about. In some cases, we do set the limits lower than 
       "all available memory" if exceeding the limit is almost certainly a bug, 
       having the bus enforce a limit is nicer than a huge memory leak. But the 
       intent is that these limits should never be hit. -->
